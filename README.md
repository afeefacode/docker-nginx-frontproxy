# docker-nginx-frontproxy

An nginx proxy server to run local projects using custom domain names and autogenerated ssl certificates.

## Description

Having multiple projects running the same time on different ports on localhost can become quite confusing. Which port serves which project? How to manage a bigger number of projects?

```bash
localhost:8080 # project 1
localhost:8081 # project 2
...
localhost:808(n-1) # project n
```

We can solve the project identification problem by creating local domain names. We can solve the port distribution problem by running the projects each inside a docker container.

```bash
project1.test # -> project-1-docker:80
project2.test # -> project-2-docker:80
...
projectn.test # -> project-n-docker:80
```

To access these projects from the host machine, e.g. via `http://project1.test`, we need now a proxy server, that maps (proxies) our local domains to docker containers.

`docker-nginx-frontproxy` is such a proxy server that:

* runs in a docker container and listens on hosts port 80
* provides a cli to create or remove proxy configurations
* autogenerates ssl certificates for each domain added

## Architecture

## Installation

### Requirements

* Docker
* PHP >=7.4 for the cli tool
* PHP composer to install the cli tool

### Install

Checkout the project, install the cli, setup ssl certificates and localhost, start the docker container:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:afeefacode/docker-nginx-frontproxy.git
cd docker-nginx-frontproxy
composer install
./nginx-frontproxy setup
docker-compose up
```

## Adding a server

Just pass a local domain name and a corresponding docker container name. You may specify a port (if other than 80).

```bash
./nginx-frontproxy add-server my-domain.test my-domain-service
./nginx-frontproxy add-server my-other-domain.test my-other-domain-service:8080
```

It's also possible to proxy a non docker localhost service:

```bash
./nginx-frontproxy add-server my-nondocker-domain.test localhost:8080
```


Don't forget to add the domain to your local `/etc/hosts` file.

```bash
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.0.1 my-domain.test # <-- added
127.0.0.1 my-other-local-domain.test
```

You might use the [hostess](https://github.com/cbednarski/hostess) tool.

```
hostess add my-domain.test 127.0.0.1
```

## Removing a server

```bash
./nginx-frontproxy remove-server my-domain.test
```

Don't forget to remove the domain from your local `/etc/hosts` file.

You might use the hostess tool (see above).

```bash
hostess rm my-domain.test
```
